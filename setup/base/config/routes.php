Routes are by default implied. For example http://example.com/accounts/ will route to the index function in the
AccountsController. You only need to enter exceptions in this file. For example you could make
http://example.com/login map to the login function in the SessionsController. To do this, you would put the
following in this file:

$config['routes'] = array(
  array('/login','sessions', 'login')
);
